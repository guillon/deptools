# Synopsis

The deptools utilities provide a simple source dependency scheme for
managing a multiple components project.

The list of components is stored in a simple _DEPENDENCIES_ file at the
root of the parent component.

A _dependencies_ script stored at the root of the component is in charge of
interpreting the list of dependencies.

The components may be hosted in distinct repositories and repository formats.  

The only requirements for starting a project are thus:
* the dependencies script (https://buildhive.cloudbees.com/job/guillon/job/deptools/ws/dependencies)
* a well formed _DEPENDENCIES_ specification (ref to the example below).

# Example

For instance here is a specification for the head branch of the deptools
project components, including the sources tree and the GitHub project pages:

    $ cd deptools-all
    $ cat DEPENDENCIES
    configurations:
      default: [ dep-tools, gh-pages ]
    repositories:
      dep-tools:
        format: git
        repos: https://github.com/guillon/deptools.git
        label: master
        alias: dep-tools
      gh-pages:
        format: git
        repos: https://github.com/guillon/deptools.git
        label: gh-pages

The `dependencies` script that can be stored with the components
description is used to extract the components:

    $ cd deptools-all
    $ ./dependencies extract
    Cloning into 'deptools'  # This is actually a dependency of the ./dependencies script itself
    Cloning into 'dep-tools' # This is the first component described in the default configuration
    Cloning into 'gh-pages'  # This is the second component

The actual manifest for a specific version of the components is obtained
for instance with:

    $ ./dependencies dump_actual | tee MANIFEST-v0.1
    configurations:
      default: [dep-tools, gh-pages]
    repositories:
      dep-tools: {alias: dep-tools, format: git, label: master, repos: 'https://github.com/guillon/deptools.git',
        revision: 8c4045382b170ae6b21d6ca4544b8f28c20cd40a}
      gh-pages: {format: git, label: gh-pages, repos: 'https://github.com/guillon/deptools.git',
        revision: d7489431c04960efe3080e8a49578381266926c5}
 
It can be stored in the deptools-all project for latter extraction:

    $ cd deptools-all
    $ ./dependencies extract -f MANIFEST-v0.1

For projects with strict management of components revision, the `DEPENDENCIES` file
should actually always contain the revision of each component. Updating a component
to a new revision implies also a new revision for the project. Indeed, the
`DEPENDENCIES` file has to be updated and commited. In this case the `DEPENDENCIES`
files acts as an always up-to-date manifest.

# Usage

The supported repositories formats are implemented as plugins to deptools:
* git: git repository
* svn: subversion repositories
* tar: archive files
* hg: mercurial (to be tested)

A ./.deptools directory at the point of extraction may be created for caching
fetched objects or for temporary usage. Note that it may hold an important
part of the disk space depending on the repository format.

Also, if using the dependencies bootstrap script referenced above, the
deptools tool itself will be extracted in the ./deptools directory which
it thus also reserved in this case.

The actions that can be run on each component are for instance:
* extract: extract components from their respective repositories
* commit: commit changes
* update/rebase: update or rebase from the origin repositories
* deliver: push back to the origin repositories
* dump_actual: dumps a manifest with actual revision that can be in turn used
as a _DEPENDENCIES_ file

For instance, deptools may help solving source dependencies issues such as:
* describing that the build of project A depends upon sources of project B
at revision X in branch B and upon the file F in unique path P,
* providing a simple command for extracting dependencies of project A, i.e.
extracting repository B under directory b and file F under filename f,
* enforcing that the unique revision/label R of source tree A is sufficient
to uniquely identify A and all its source dependencies at the right revisions,
* easily identify, extract, commit, update all components at once,
* referencing uniformly svn, git, mercurial repositories, or
ftp, ssh, http URIs.

# Limitations

The deptools utilities do not provide support for:
* actually building source components and dependencies,
* installing cache of build results,
* specifying runtime dependencies between components.

# Related Tools

A number of other tools provide the same kind of services, though the deptools
utilities aim at being independent of the components repositories formats
which is not the case generally. Tools such as repo or maven2 are well
suited in homogeneous development environment, but are limited to either a
specific type of repository or not well suited for source level dependency
management.
